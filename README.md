# Port Scanner

This is a simple Python-based port scanner that can be used to scan open ports on a remote host. It supports multithreaded scanning for faster results, service version detection via banner grabbing, and basic operating system detection.

## Features
- **Multithreaded scanning**: Scans multiple ports concurrently for faster execution.
- **Service version detection**: Tries to determine the version of services running on open ports using banner grabbing.
- **OS detection**: Provides basic operating system information (limited to the local system for now).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies are required for this script, as it only uses Python’s built-in libraries.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/port-scanner.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd port-scanner
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 port_scanner.py
   ```

## Usage
1. After running the script, you will be prompted to enter the target host (e.g., an IP address or domain).
2. Then, input the range of ports you want to scan (e.g., from port 20 to 1024).
3. The script will output the status of each port (open or closed) and attempt to identify the service version running on open ports.
4. It will also try to detect the operating system based on the local machine's platform.

### Example:

```
Enter the host to scan (e.g., 127.0.0.1 or example.com): example.com
Enter the starting port (e.g., 20): 20
Enter the ending port (e.g., 1024): 1024

Scanning ports 20-1024 on example.com...
Port 22 is open
  Service on port 22: OpenSSH 8.3p1 Ubuntu 1
Port 80 is open
  Service on port 80: Apache httpd 2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
...
Detecting OS...
OS Info: Linux OS (detected by local system)
```

## How it works
- The script uses a **socket** to attempt a connection to the specified ports on the remote host.
- **ThreadPoolExecutor** is used for concurrent connections, speeding up the scan.
- It attempts to grab a banner from services running on open ports to determine their version (e.g., SSH, HTTP).
- The script tries to detect the local operating system using Python’s `platform.system()`.
